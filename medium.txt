We have taken all anxietyinto our dreamscruel, unfathomable acts lodge into our fascia, as painPart of a raging beast, oozing out of controlhelpless cells, imbued with a wisdomovercome by cancerous greed. We chase frothy bubbleslose concerns in selfishpursuits-far be it from us to bethe conduit that delivers peaceOur earthseen from a moon flighthas a fragile beauty well known to usIts oceans are blue miracles, clear water, pure air, be-mucked by enterpriseand murder, murder everywhere.Cities spread un- checked, razing field and forestDeath hangs over us- the years too briefTwo and fro we leap from history to historyBlood and mayhem and un-numbered griefs.The world, so  full of trouble, as Utopia sleeps
